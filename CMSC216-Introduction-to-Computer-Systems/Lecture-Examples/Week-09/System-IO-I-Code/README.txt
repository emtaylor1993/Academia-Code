For fileOpen.c:
   1. It relies on file.txt file.  Put some content in it before running 
      program.
   2. Remove new-file.txt if it exists before running the program.
   2. Execute once to see files created.  Notice that file.txt is now empty.
   3. Change permissions of new-file.txt to 400 and run again (to see access 
      failure).
