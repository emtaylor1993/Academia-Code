Add the line that follows ADD_FOLLOWING_LINE to the 
file .aliases that can be found in your home directory 
(cd ~).  Log out and then log on again to see the changes.  
You can verify it is correct if you execute alias gcc 
and see the new options.  If you don't have a .aliases
file, just create one (notice it needs a period before aliases).
By the way, you may want to add a blank line after the alias
directive to make sure the alias works.

ADD_FOLLOWING_LINE

alias gcc "gcc -ansi -Wall -g -O0 -Wwrite-strings -Wshadow -pedantic-errors -fstack-protector-all"
