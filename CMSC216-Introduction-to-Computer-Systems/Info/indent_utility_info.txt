1. The indent utility allows you indent C source code.

2. The following is an example of how to run the utility 
   on the file indentExampleBefore.c (available in this
   directory).  Notice that the file is replaced with
   the indented code.

   indent indentExampleBefore.c 

3. You should use this utility to indent your C code, 
   however, keep in mind that no utility is perfect
   so you should check the final indentation is what
   you are after.  Also, make sure you compile your
   code after running indent.
   
4. You need a set options to generate a style close
   to what projects in cmsc106 and cmsc216 require.
   To set your grace account with the appropriate options
   see step 5 below.  

5. Add the line that follows ADD_FOLLOWING_LINE to the 
   file .aliases that can be found in your home directory 
   (cd ~).  Log out and then log on again to see the changes.  
   You can verify it is correct if you execute alias indent
   and see the new options.  If you don't have a .aliases
   file, just create one (notice it needs a period 
   before aliases). By the way, you may want to add a blank 
   line after the alias directive to make sure the alias works.
 

ADD_FOLLOWING_LINE

alias indent "indent -npsl -br -i3 -di3 -ce -npcs -brf -sob -cli3 -nbbo -nut -l78"
